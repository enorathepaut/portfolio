							<h2 class="heading-inline text-contrast">Overview</h2>
							<p>Over the past five years I have gained experience in digital design and art direction for films, photography and illustration. Before that I tried my hand at letterpress and worked as a designer for the cultural industries.</p>
						    <p>Born in France, I settled in London since 2009 after having visited a few other countries. I have a passion for discovering new cultures and people which has led me to speak 5 languages fluently. Have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enorathepaut" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile </a> to know more. </p>

							<h2 class="heading-inline text-contrast">Testimonials</h2>
							<p>&ldquo;I worked with Enora for at least 4 years. When you are looking for new designers you want talent and you want intelligence. That's what Enora has; the ability to think strategically about a brief, but also the ability to turn thinking into great work. And the rate of development from intern to fully formed and important member of my team was impressive. I really rate Enora and would happily work with her given half a chance again.&rdquo; <span class="text-small">&mdash; <cite>David Stocks</cite>, Executive Creative Director at SAS</span></p>
							<p>&ldquo;A sublime talent that interprets the human psyche and outlier trends into a visual masterpiece. Enora is a rare find, a true creative thinker that doesn’t accept a brief, she writes it. Tenacious in her desire to change perceptions she brings fresh perspectives that set you off on new directions through pithy discussions that stretch strategy from something clients expect to something they would never have imagined without her.&rdquo; <span class="text-small">&mdash; <cite>Rosanna Covacich</cite>, Corporate Brand Strategist, Client Partner at MSLGroup</span></p>
